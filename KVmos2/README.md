# New KVmos

### To FIX

There are parts of teh AVR core functions that need precise timing and execution, which based on the inmense size of the current codebase for KVmos, will for obious reasons never get to execute on time. Is for that reason that it must be find a solution to the timing problems.

### New things

KVmos 2 has included major improvements compared to the last versions.

- Full implementation of modern and advanced ZFS2 (More information on *doc*).
- Fully functional memory allocator and MMU with memory virtualization.
- Dynamic and static calling, aswell as fully dynamic syscall implementation ability.
- The Third version of ZVM comes here too, implementing even more moder and effitient ways to call each operand, and the behaviour of each option bit is now improved to be more, Logical.

## Special Thanks

Special thanks to Myself!! For working so hard to allways make better software. KVmos 2 is a major improvement compared to KVmos 1, and far more complex. It was fun to make, and even if i leave it more or less incomplete (Until someday my future self finds a better way to build this), i will always apreciate my work!
